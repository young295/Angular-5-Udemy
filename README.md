# Angular 5 Udemy Course | by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

This is my work following a video lecture course created and curated by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The course presents a complete guide on Angular 5 beginning with basics being taught lecture-by-lecture, but then working up to a full project.

# Course File Structure

#### Basics || my-first-app
The directory 'my-first-app' is the directory in which the Basics section of the course is taught inside of. Each lecture adds and makes changes to the files in the 'my-first-app' directory, while assignments will each have their own directories.

#### Components & Datatbinding Deep Dive || cmp-databinding-start
The directory 'cmp-databinding-start' was a starter resource given to work in for the section that teaches more in-depth concepts about components and data binding on top of what was learned in the basics section.

#### Assignments
The assignment directories are included as zipped resources from the online course, so were initialized by the instructor, then completed by myself. The assignments are each just a simple set of instructions that review the topics from the preceding video lectures.
