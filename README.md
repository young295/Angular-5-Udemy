# Angular 5 Udemy Course | by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

This is my work following a video lecture course created and curated by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The course presents a complete guide on Angular 5 beginning with basics being taught lecture-by-lecture, but then working up to a full project.

# Course File Structure
The course is broken down into various sections outlining the available and important features of Angular. At the beginning of each section there is a new starting directory to download with base code that I add to and change over the course of that section's lectures. I will list each below and a little small detail about what the section entails.

### Basics || my-first-app
The directory, 'my-first-app', is the directory in which the Basics section of the course is taught inside of. Each lecture adds and makes changes to the files in the 'my-first-app' directory, while assignments will each have their own directories.

### Components & Datatbinding Deep Dive || cmp-databinding-start
The directory, 'cmp-databinding-start', was the starting resource given to work in for the section that teaches more in-depth concepts about components and data binding on top of what was learned in the basics section.

### Directives Deep Dive || directives-start
The directory, 'directives-start', was the starting directory given for the section of the course that dove deeper into how directives work, more about the types of directives, and how we can create our own.

### Using Services & Dependency Injection|| services-start
The directory, 'services-start', was the starting directory given for the section of the course that introduced the concept of services and how they can be implemented properly using dependency injection.

### Changing Pages with Routing || routing-start
The directory, 'routing-start', was the starting resource directory given for the section of the course that indroduced routing for the first time. Before this module, I had not dealt with routing, only switching what is shown on the page by using *ngIf conditions on separate divs.

### Understanding Observables || observables-start
The directory, 'observables-start', was the starting directory given for the section of the course that introduced Observables. In the routing section, observables were used as a return type regarding the simple auth and auth guard services we implemented. This section will dive deeper into observables and waht they are, what they can be used for, and why Angular uses them.

### Handling Forms in Angular Apps || forms-td-start | forms-reactive-start
The directories, 'forms-td-start' and 'forms-reactive-start', were the starting directories given for the section of the course that introduced forms with Angular. I have done work with forms in HTML5, PHP, and .NET, but have never used javascript in any way, so this section is a fresh subject for me as a whole. The course outlines two methods of creating forms using Angular: Template-Driven and Reactive. There are two separate directories worked in for this section to differentiate the two types of forms I learned.

### Assignments
The assignment directories are included as zipped resources from the online course, so were initialized by the instructor, then completed by myself. The assignments are each just a simple set of instructions that review the topics from the preceding video lectures.
