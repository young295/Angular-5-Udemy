# Angular 5 Udemy Course | by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

This is my work following a video lecture course created and curated by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The course presents a complete guide on Angular 5 beginning with basics being taught lecture-by-lecture, but then working up to a full project.

# Course File Structure

### Basics || my-first-app
The directory, 'my-first-app', is the directory in which the Basics section of the course is taught inside of. Each lecture adds and makes changes to the files in the 'my-first-app' directory, while assignments will each have their own directories.

### Components & Datatbinding Deep Dive || cmp-databinding-start
The directory, 'cmp-databinding-start', was the starting resource given to work in for the section that teaches more in-depth concepts about components and data binding on top of what was learned in the basics section.

### Directives Deep Dive || directives-start
The directory, 'directives-start', was the starting directory given for the section of the course that dove deeper into how directives work, more about the types of directives, and how we can create our own.

### Using Services & Dependency Injection
The directory 'services-start' was the starting directory given for the section of the course that introduced the concept of services and how they can be implemented properly using dependency injection.

### Assignments
The assignment directories are included as zipped resources from the online course, so were initialized by the instructor, then completed by myself. The assignments are each just a simple set of instructions that review the topics from the preceding video lectures.
