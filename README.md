# Angular 5 Udemy Course | by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

This is my work following a video lecture course created and curated by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The course presents a complete guide on Angular 5 beginning with basics being taught lecture-by-lecture, but then working up to a full project.

# Course File Structure

The directory 'my-first-app' is the directory in which the ongoing course is taught inside of. Each lecture adds and makes changes to the files in the 'my-first-app' directory, while assignments will each have their own directory.
