# Angular 5 Udemy Course | by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

This is my work following a video lecture course created and curated by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The course presents a complete guide on Angular 5 beginning with basics being taught lecture-by-lecture, but then working up to a full project.

# Course File Structure

The directory 'my-first-app' is the directory in which the Basics section of the course is taught inside of. Each lecture adds and makes changes to the files in the 'my-first-app' directory, while assignments will each have their own directories.

The directory 'cmp-databinding-start' was a starter resource given to work in for the section that teaches more in-depth concepts about components and data binding on top of what was learned in the basics section.

The assignment directories are included as zipped resources from the online course, so were initialized by the instructor, then completed by myself. The assignments are just a simple set of instructions that review the topics from the preceding video lectures.
